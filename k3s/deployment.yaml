# There  is  an  option  to  define a  Service  without  selectors  by
# specifying  the corresponding  Endpoints  explicitly.  We  separated
# Grafana and  Data Source into seprate  Pods --- in case  you want to
# point your Grafana to an external service using this thechnique.
#
# The followinf  "datasource" Service makes the  Data Source available
# to other Pods  including Grafana.  Grafana Config  can use hardcoded
# http://datasource  as  the  URL.  Resolving  Services  on  arbitrary
# appears cumbersome --- we assume and hardcode Port 80 here.
